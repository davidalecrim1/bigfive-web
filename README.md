# BigFive Web
This project is inspired in [bigfive-web](https://github.com/rubynor/bigfive-web). The initial idea here is to clone it using Go, HTMX and Templ to experiment with the technology.

## Stack
- **Go** for creating the server side app.
- **HTMX** is being used for the user interface to extend HTML capabilities.
- **Templ** is being used to work HTML with type safety in Go.
- **Bootstrap** is being used as a framework for styling the front-end (i.e. the backend developer best friend).
- **Air** is being used for live reloading of the Go app.
