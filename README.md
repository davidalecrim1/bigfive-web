# BigFive Web

This project is inspired in [bigfive-web](https://github.com/rubynor/bigfive-web). The initial idea here is to clone it using Go and HTMX to experiment with the technology.


## Stack
- **HTMX** is being used for the front-end to extend HTML capabilities.
- **Templ** is being used to work HTML with type safety in Go.
- **Tailwind** is being used as a framework for styling the front-end.
